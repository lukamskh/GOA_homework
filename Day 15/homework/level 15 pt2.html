 <p>The Galaxy S24 and S24+ feature aluminum versions, and are available in four standard colors: Amber Yellow, Marble Gray, Cobalt Violet, and Onyx Black, with three additional colors available only through Samsung's website: Jade Green, Sapphire Blue and Sandstone Orange. The S24 Ultra features titanium versions of these colors.</p>
 <h2>Display</h2>
 <p>The Galaxy S24 series features a "Dynamic AMOLED 2X" display with HDR10+ support, 2600 nits of peak brightness, and "dynamic tone mapping" technology. All models use an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint sensor. The S24 series uses a variable refresh rate display with a range of 1 Hz[13] or 24 Hz to 120 Hz.

  The Galaxy S24 Ultra uses Corning Gorilla Glass Armor glass and low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPO) technology on its display, but it drops the curved sides seen in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. </p>
