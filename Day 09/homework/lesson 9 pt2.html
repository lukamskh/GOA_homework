<h2>what are rubiks cubes</h2>
<p>In the mid-1970s, Ern≈ë Rubik worked at the Department of Interior Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest.[19] Although it is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire mechanism falling apart.</p>
